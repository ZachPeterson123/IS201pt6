    <h3>Why am I studying Entrepreneurial Management?</h3>
    <p>School has always come pretty easy to me and college hasn't been an exception to that so far. I'm good at math, I can grasp things quickly, and I generally enjoy learning.
        But the thing that really excites me and gets me going is complex problem solving. I just love looking at problems and trying to find out of the box solutions - things that nobody
        has ever tried or even thought about before. Entrepreneurship to me is all about solving problems outside the scope of normal occupations, and it gets me excited to wake up every 
        morning to figure out what new goal I'm going to work on that day.</p>

    <p>I also really want to be able to make a difference in the world and help people. One of my long term goals is to be in a position that I can start a charity of some sort that
         focuses on bringing the quality of life up for those who are less fortunate that I am. I've seen so so many capable people live the hardest lives simply because they don't
        know how to break the bubble that they're stuck in. I think we can help to educate and get people on the path of their true potential if we just give them a chance. My parents
        are the type of people who have supported me through whatever I have ever wanted in life and that is why I am where I am today. They never made me wonder if I could really do
        it, but instead made sure I knew that they were always there for me when I needed help. That type of encouragement, motivation, and mindset is what we need in every
        place of employment, every sports team, and every school in the world.</p>
